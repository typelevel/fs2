### Overview

FS2 is a library for purely functional, effectful, and polymorphic stream processing library in the [Scala programming language](https://scala-lang.org).
Its design goals are compositionality, expressiveness, resource safety, and speed.
The name is a modified acronym for **F**unctional **S**treams for **Scala** (FSS, or FS2).

FS2 is available for Scala 2.12, Scala 2.13, Scala 3, and [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).
FS2 is built upon two major functional libraries for Scala, [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/), and [Cats-Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).
Regardless of those dependencies, FS2 core types (streams and pulls) are polymorphic in the effect type (as long as it is compatible with `cats-effect` typeclasses),
and thus FS2 can be used with other effect libraries, such as [Monix](https://monix.io/).

### <a id="docs"></a>Documentation and getting help ###

* There are Scaladoc API documentations for [the core library][core-api], which defines and implements the core types for streams and pulls, as well as the type aliases for pipes and sinks. [The `io` library][io-api] provides FS2 bindings for NIO-based file I/O and TCP/UDP networking.
* [The official guide](https://fs2.io/#/guide) is a good starting point for learning more about the library.
* The [documentation page](https://fs2.io/#/documentation) is intended to serve as a list of all references, including conference presentation recordings, academic papers, and blog posts, on the use and implementation of `fs2`.
* [The FAQ](https://fs2.io/#/faq) has frequently asked questions. Feel free to open issues or PRs with additions to the FAQ!
* Also feel free to come discuss and ask/answer questions in [the Typelevel Discord channel](https://discord.gg/9V8FZTVZ9R) and/or on StackOverflow using [the tag FS2](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/fs2). Discord will generally get you a quicker answer.

### Projects using FS2 ###

You can find a list of libraries and integrations with data stores built on top of FS2 here: [https://fs2.io/#/ecosystem](https://fs2.io/#/ecosystem).

If you have a project you'd like to include in this list, please open a PR or let us know in [the Discord channel](https://discord.gg/9V8FZTVZ9R) and we'll add a link to it.
