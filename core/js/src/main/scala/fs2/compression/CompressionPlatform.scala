    * Therefore, GZIP is a good choice for compressing finite, complete, readily-available,
    * continuous or file streams. A simpler deflate stream may be better suited to
    * real-time, intermittent, fragmented, interactive or discontinuous streams where
    * network protocols typically provide stream integrity validation.

    *                   the size of the largest chunk in the input stream.

    *                   the chunks in the input stream will result in
    *                   performance degradation of roughly 50-75%. Default
    *                   size is 32 KB.

    * @param deflateStrategy  strategy compression strategy -- see `java.util.zip.Deflater` for details
