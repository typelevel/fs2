  /** Returns a pipe that incrementally compresses input into the GZIP format
    * as defined by RFC 1952 at https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt. Output is
    * compatible with the GNU utils `gunzip` utility, as well as really anything
    * else that understands GZIP. Note, however, that the GZIP format is not
    * "stable" in the sense that all compressors will produce identical output
    * given identical input. Part of the header seeding is arbitrary and chosen by
    * the compression implementation. For this reason, the exact bytes produced
    * by this pipe will differ in insignificant ways from the exact bytes produced
    * by a tool like the GNU utils `gzip`.
    *
    * GZIP wraps a deflate stream with file attributes and stream integrity validation.
    * Therefore, GZIP is a good choice for compressing finite, complete, readily-available,
    * continuous or file streams. A simpler deflate stream may be better suited to
    * real-time, intermittent, fragmented, interactive or discontinuous streams where
    * network protocols typically provide stream integrity validation.
    *
    * @param bufferSize The buffer size which will be used to page data
    *                   into chunks. This will be the chunk size of the
    *                   output stream. You should set it to be equal to
    *                   the size of the largest chunk in the input stream.
    *                   Setting this to a size which is ''smaller'' than
    *                   the chunks in the input stream will result in
    *                   performance degradation of roughly 50-75%. Default
    *                   size is 32 KB.
    * @param deflateLevel     level the compression level (0-9)
    * @param deflateStrategy  strategy compression strategy -- see `java.util.zip.Deflater` for details
    * @param modificationTime optional file modification time
    * @param fileName         optional file name
    * @param comment          optional file comment
