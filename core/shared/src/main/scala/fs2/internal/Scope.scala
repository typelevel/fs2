/** Represents a period of stream execution in which resources are acquired and released.
  * A scope has a state, consisting of resources (with associated finalizers) acquired in this scope
  * and child scopes spawned from this scope.
  *
  * === Scope lifetime ===
  *
  * When stream interpretation starts, one `root` scope is created. Scopes are then created and closed based on the
  * stream structure. Every time a `Pull` is converted to a `Stream`, a scope is created.
  *
  * For example, `s.chunks` is defined with `s.repeatPull` which in turn is defined with `Pull.loop(...).stream`.
  * In this case, a single scope is created as a result of the call to `.stream`.
  *
  * Scopes may also be opened and closed manually with `Stream#scope`. For the stream `s.scope`, a scope
  * is opened before evaluation of `s` and closed once `s` finishes evaluation.
  *
  * === Scope organization ===
  *
  * Scopes are organized in tree structure, with each scope having at max one parent (a root scope has no parent)
  * with 0 or more child scopes.
  *
  * Every time a new scope is opened, it is created as a child of the current scope, with its parent set to that scope
  * and itself added as a child.
  *
  * During the interpretation of nondeterministic streams (i.e. merge), there may be multiple scopes attached
  * to a single parent and these scopes may be created and closed in a nondeterministic order.
  *
  * A child scope never outlives its parent scope. I.e., when a parent scope is closed for whatever reason,
  * the child scopes are closed too.
  *
  * === Resources ===
  *
  * The primary role of a scope is tracking resource allocation and release. The stream interpreter guarantees that
  * resources allocated in a scope are always released when the scope closes.
  *
  * === Resource allocation ===
  *
  * Resources are allocated when the interpreter interprets the `Acquire` element, which is typically constructed
  * via `Stream.bracket`. See [[ScopedResource]] docs for more information.
  *
  * @param id              Unique identification of the scope
  * @param parent          If empty indicates root scope. If non-empty, indicates parent of this scope.
  * @param interruptible   If defined, allows this scope to interrupt any of its operation. Interruption
  *                       is performed using the supplied context.
  *                       Normally the interruption awaits next step in Algebra to be evaluated, with exception
  *                       of Eval, that when interruption is enabled on scope will be wrapped in race,
  *                       that eventually allows interruption while eval is evaluating.
