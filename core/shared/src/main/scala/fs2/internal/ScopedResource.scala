/** Represents a resource acquired during stream interpretation.
  *
  * A resource is acquired by `Algebra.Acquire` and then released by `Algebra.CloseScope`.
  *
  * The acquisition of a resource has three steps:
  *
  * 1. A `ScopedResource` instance is created and registered with the current scope (`Algebra.Acquire`)
  * 2. Acquisition action is evaluated
  * 3. `acquired` is invoked to confirm acquisition of the resource
  *
  * The reason for this is that during asynchronous stream evaluation, one scope may close the other scope
  * (e.g., merged stream fails while another stream is still acquiring an asynchronous resource).
  * In such a case, a resource may be `released` before `acquired` was evaluated, resulting
  * in an immediate finalization after acquisition is confirmed.
  *
  * A resource may be released by any of the following methods:
  *
  * (1) The owning scope was closed by `Algebra.CloseScope`. This essentially evaluates `release` of
  *     the `ScopedResource` and acts like (1).
  * (2) `acquired` was evaluated after scope was `released` by either (1) or (2). In this case,
  *     finalizer will be invoked immediately if the resource is not leased.
  * (3) `cancel` is invoked on a `Lease` for the resource. This will invoke the finalizer
  *     if the resource was already acquired and released and there are no other outstanding leases.
  *
  * Scoped resources may be leased to other scopes. Each scope must lease with `lease` and  when the other
  * scope is closed (or when the resource lease is no longer required) release the lease with `Lease#cancel`.
  *
  * Note that every method which may potentially call a resource finalizer returns `F[Either[Throwable, Unit]]`
  * instead of `F[Unit]` to make sure any errors that occur when releasing the resource are properly handled.
