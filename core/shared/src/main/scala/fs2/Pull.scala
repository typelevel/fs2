/** A purely functional data structure that describes a process. This process
  * may evaluate actions in an effect type F, emit any number of output values
  * of type O (or None), and may a) terminate with a single result of type R;
  * or b) terminate abnormally by raising (inside the effect `F`) an exception,
  * or c) terminate because it was cancelled by another process,
  * or d) not terminate.
  *
  * Like types from other effect libraries, pulls are pure and immutable values.
  * They preserve referential transparency.
  *
  * === Chunking ===
  *
  * The output values of a pull are emitted not one by one, but in chunks.
  * A `Chunk` is an immutable sequence with constant-time indexed lookup. For example,
  * a pull `p: Pull[F, Byte, R]` internally operates and emits `Chunk[Byte]`
  * values, which can wrap unboxed byte arrays -- avoiding boxing/unboxing costs.
  * The `Pull` API provides mechanisms for working at both the chunk level and
  * the individual element level. Generally, working at the chunk level will
  * result in better performance but at the cost of more complex implementations
  *
  * A pull only emits non-empty chunks.
  *
  * However, chunks are not merely an operational matter of efficiency. Each
  * pull is emitted from a chunk atomically, which is to say, any errors or
  * interruptions in a pull can only happen between chunks, not within a
  * chunk. For instance, if creating a new chunk of values fails (raises an
  * uncaught exception) while creating an intermediate value, then it fails
  * to create the entire chunk and previous values are discarded.
  *
  * === Evaluation ===
  *
  * Like other functional effect types (e.g. `cats.effect.IO`), a pull
  * describes a _process_ or _computation_. It is not a running process nor a
  * handle for the result of a spawned, running process, like `scala.concurrent.Future`.
  *
  * A pull can be converted to a stream and then compiled to an effectful value.
  * For a `Pull[F, O, Unit]`, the result of compilation is a combination, via the
  * monad instance of `F`, of all the actions in the effect `F` present in the pull.
  * The result of that `F` action is the result of combining the outputs emitted by
  * the pull, in the order it emits them, using a _fold_ function. Depending on that
  * function, outputs may be collected into a list (or vector or array or ...),
  * combined together into a single value, or just discarded altogether (by _draining_
  * the pull).
  *
  * Compilation is pull-based, rather than push-based (hence the name of the datatype).
  * It is the compilation process itself, that determines when the evaluation
  * of each single effect can proceed or is held back. Effects and outputs later
  * in the pull are not performed or emitted, _unless and until_ the compilation
  * calls for them.
  *
  * === Resource scoping ===
  *
  * The effects in a `Pull` may operate on resources, which must be retained during
  * the execution of the pull, may be shared by several pulls, and must be
  * properly finalised when no longer needed, regardless of whether the pull completed
  * successfully or not. A pull tracks its resources using '''scopes''', which register
  * how many pulls are actively using each resource, and finalises resources when no
  * longer used.
  *
  * Some operations of the `Pull` API can be used to introduce new resource scopes,
  * or resource boundaries.
  *
  * === Functional typeclasses ===
  *
  * The `Pull` data structure is a "free" implementation of `Monad` and has an instance
  * for `cats.effect.kernel.Sync`.
  *
  * For any types `F[_]` and `O`, a `Pull[F, O, *]` holds the following laws:
  *
  *   - `pure >=> f == f`
  *   - `f >=> pure == f`
  *   - `(f >=> g) >=> h == f >=> (g >=> h)`
  * where `f >=> g` is defined as `a => a flatMap f flatMap g`
  *   - `handleErrorWith(raiseError(e))(f) == f(e)`
  *
  * @tparam F[_] the type of effect that can be performed by this pull.
  *         An effect type of `Nothing`, also known in `fs2` by the alias `Pure`,
  *         indicates that this pull perform no effectful actions.
  *         _Note_: `Nothing` is a polykinded type, so it can also be
  *         applied as an argument to the type parameter `F[_]`.
  * @tparam O The outputs emitted by this Pull. An output type of `Nothing` means
  *           that this pull does not emit any outputs.
  * @tparam R The type of result returned by this Pull upon successful termination.
  *           An output type of `Nothing` indicates that this pull cannot terminate
  *           successfully: it may fail, be cancelled, or never terminate.
