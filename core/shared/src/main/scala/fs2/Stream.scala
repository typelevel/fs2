/** A stream producing output of type `O` and which may evaluate `F` effects.
  *
  * - '''Purely functional''' a value of type `Stream[F, O]` _describes_ an effectful computation.
  *    A function that returns a `Stream[F, O]` builds a _description_ of an effectful computation,
  *    but does not perform them. The methods of the `Stream` class derive new descriptions from others.
  *    This is similar to how effect types like `cats.effect.IO` and `monix.Task` build descriptions of
  *    computations.
  *
  * - '''Pull''': to evaluate a stream, a consumer pulls its values from it, by repeatedly performing one pull step at a time.
  *   Each step is a `F`-effectful computation that may yield some `O` values (or none), and a stream from which to continue pulling.
  *   The consumer controls the evaluation of the stream, which effectful operations are performed, and when.
  *
  * - '''Non-Strict''': stream evaluation only pulls from the stream a prefix large enough to compute its results.
  *   Thus, although a stream may yield an unbounded number of values or, after successfully yielding several values,
  *   either raise an error or hang up and never yield any value, the consumer need not reach those points of failure.
  *   For the same reason, in general, no effect in `F` is evaluated unless and until the consumer needs it.
  *
  * - '''Abstract''': a stream needs not be a plain finite list of fixed effectful computations in F.
  *   It can also represent an input or output connection through which data incrementally arrives.
  *   It can represent an effectful computation, such as reading the system's time, that can be re-evaluated
  *   as often as the consumer of the stream requires.
  *
  * === Special properties for streams ===
  *
  * There are some special properties or cases of streams:
  *  - A stream is '''finite''' if we can reach the end after a limited number of pull steps,
  *    which may yield a finite number of values. It is '''empty''' if it terminates and yields no values.
  *  - A '''singleton''' stream is a stream that ends after yielding one single value.
  *  - A '''pure''' stream is one in which the `F` is [[Pure]], which indicates that it evaluates no effects.
  *  - A '''never''' stream is a stream that never terminates and never yields any value.
  *
  * == Pure Streams and operations ==
  *
  * We can sometimes think of streams, naively, as lists of `O` elements with `F`-effects.
  * This is particularly true for '''pure''' streams, which are instances of `Stream` which use the [[Pure]] effect type.
  * We can convert every ''pure and finite'' stream into a `List[O]` using the `.toList` method.
  * Also, we can convert pure ''infinite'' streams into instances of the `Stream[O]` class from the Scala standard library.
  *
  * A method of the `Stream` class is '''pure''' if it can be applied to pure streams. Such methods are identified
  * in that their signature includes no type-class constraint (or implicit parameter) on the `F` method.
  * Pure methods in `Stream[F, O]` can be projected ''naturally'' to methods in the `List` class, which means
  * that applying the stream's method and converting the result to a list gets the same result as
  * first converting the stream to a list, and then applying list methods.
  *
  * Some methods that project directly to list are `map`, `filter`, `takeWhile`, etc.
  * There are other methods, like `exists` or `find`, that in the `List` class they return a value or an `Option`,
  * but their stream counterparts return an (either empty or singleton) stream.
  * Other methods, like `zipWithPrevious`, have a more complicated but still pure translation to list methods.
  *
  * == Type-Class instances and laws of the Stream Operations ==
  *
  * Laws (using infix syntax):
  *
  * `append` forms a monoid in conjunction with `empty`:
  *   - `empty append s == s` and `s append empty == s`.
  *   - `(s1 append s2) append s3 == s1 append (s2 append s3)`
  *
  * And `cons` is consistent with using `++` to prepend a single chunk:
  *   - `s.cons(c) == Stream.chunk(c) ++ s`
  *
  * `Stream.raiseError` propagates until being caught by `handleErrorWith`:
  *   - `Stream.raiseError(e) handleErrorWith h == h(e)`
  *   - `Stream.raiseError(e) ++ s == Stream.raiseError(e)`
  *   - `Stream.raiseError(e) flatMap f == Stream.raiseError(e)`
  *
  * `Stream` forms a monad with `emit` and `flatMap`:
  *   - `Stream.emit >=> f == f` (left identity)
  *   - `f >=> Stream.emit === f` (right identity - note weaker equality notion here)
  *   - `(f >=> g) >=> h == f >=> (g >=> h)` (associativity)
  *  where `Stream.emit(a)` is defined as `chunk(Chunk.singleton(a)) and
  *  `f >=> g` is defined as `a => a flatMap f flatMap g`
  *
  * The monad is the list-style sequencing monad:
  *   - `(a ++ b) flatMap f == (a flatMap f) ++ (b flatMap f)`
  *   - `Stream.empty flatMap f == Stream.empty`
  *
  * == Technical notes==
  *
  * ''Note:'' since the chunk structure of the stream is observable, and
  * `s flatMap Stream.emit` produces a stream of singleton chunks,
  * the right identity law uses a weaker notion of equality, `===` which
  * normalizes both sides with respect to chunk structure:
  *
  *   `(s1 === s2) = normalize(s1) == normalize(s2)`
  *   where `==` is full equality
  *   (`a == b` iff `f(a)` is identical to `f(b)` for all `f`)
  *
  * `normalize(s)` can be defined as `s.flatMap(Stream.emit)`, which just
  * produces a singly-chunked stream from any input stream `s`.
  *
  * For instance, for a stream `s` and a function `f: A => B`,
  * - the result of `s.map(f)` is a Stream with the same _chunking_ as the `s`; wheras...
  * - the result of `s.flatMap(x => S.emit(f(x)))` is a Stream structured as a sequence of singleton chunks.
  * The latter is using the definition of `map` that is derived from the `Monad` instance.
  *
  * This is not unlike equality for maps or sets, which is defined by which elements they contain,
  * not by how these are spread between a tree's branches or a hashtable buckets.
  * However, a `Stream` structure can be _observed_ through the `chunks` method,
  * so two streams "_equal_" under that notion may give different results through this method.
  *
  * ''Note:'' For efficiency `[[Stream.map]]` function operates on an entire
  * chunk at a time and preserves chunk structure, which differs from
  * the `map` derived from the monad (`s map f == s flatMap (f andThen Stream.emit)`)
  * which would produce singleton chunk. In particular, if `f` throws errors, the
  * chunked version will fail on the first ''chunk'' with an error, while
  * the unchunked version will fail on the first ''element'' with an error.
  * Exceptions in pure code like this are strongly discouraged.

      *
      * And so on for every other method in `compile`.
      *
      * The main use case is interacting with Stream methods whose
      * behaviour depends on the Stream lifetime, in cases where you
      * only want to ultimately return a single element.
      *
      * A typical example of this is concurrent combinators, here is
      * an example with `concurrently`:
      *
      * {{{
      * import fs2._
      * import cats.effect._
      * import cats.effect.kernel.Ref
      * import scala.concurrent.duration._
      *
      * trait StopWatch[F[_]] {
      *   def elapsedSeconds: F[Int]
      * }
      * object StopWatch {
      *   def create[F[_]](implicit F: Temporal[F]): Stream[F, StopWatch[F]] =
      *     Stream.eval(F.ref(0)).flatMap { c =>
      *       val api = new StopWatch[F] {
      *         def elapsedSeconds: F[Int] = c.get
      *       }
      *
      *       val process = Stream.fixedRate(1.second).evalMap(_ => c.update(_ + 1))
      *
      *       Stream.emit(api).concurrently(process)
      *   }
      * }
      * }}}
      *
      * This creates a simple abstraction that can be queried by
      * multiple consumers to find out how much time has passed, with
      * a concurrent stream to update it every second.
      *
      * Note that `create` returns a `Stream[F, StopWatch[F]]`, even
      * though there is only one instance being emitted: this is less than ideal,
      *  so we might think about returning an `F[StopWatch[F]]` with the following code
      *
      * {{{
      * StopWatch.create[F].compile.lastOrError
      * }}}
      *
      * but it does not work: the returned `F` terminates the lifetime of the stream,
      * which causes `concurrently` to stop the `process` stream. As a  result, `elapsedSeconds`
      * never gets updated.
      *
      * Alternatively, we could implement `StopWatch` in `F` only
      * using `Fiber.start`, but this is not ideal either:
      * `concurrently` already handles errors, interruption and
      * stopping the producer stream once the consumer lifetime is
      * over, and we don't want to reimplement the machinery for that.
      *
      * So basically what we need is a type that expresses the concept of lifetime,
      * while only ever emitting a single element, which is exactly what `cats.effect.Resource` does.
      *
      * What `compile.resource` provides is the ability to do this:
      *
      * {{{
      * object StopWatch {
      *   // ... def create as before ...
      *
      *   def betterCreate[F[_]: Temporal]: Resource[F, StopWatch[F]] =
      *     create.compile.resource.lastOrError
      * }
      * }}}

      * This works for every other `compile.` method, although it's a
      * very natural fit with `lastOrError`.
