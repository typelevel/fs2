/** A time series is a stream of timestamped values or clock ticks.
  *
  * Values are represented as `Some` values in a `TimeStamped[Option[A]]`, whereas
  * clock ticks are represented as `None`s. This encoding allows for an indication
  * of time passage with no observed values.
  *
  * Generally, time series appear in increasing order, and many combinators that work with
  * time series will rely on that. For streams that are globally ordered, but not locally ordered,
  * i.e., near adjacent values might be out of order but values at great distance from each other
  * are ordered, consider using `TimeStamped.reorderLocally` to adjust.
