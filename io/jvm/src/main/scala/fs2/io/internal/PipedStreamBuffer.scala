/** Thread safe circular byte buffer which pipes a [[java.io.OutputStream]]

  * copying bytes unnecessarily.
  *
  * @note As per the interfaces of the [[java.io]] classes, all of the
  * operations are blocking in nature and extra care should be taken when using
  * the exposed input/output streams. Thread safety is ensured by
  * synchronizing on individual objects of this class.
  *
  * This is, in spirit, a clean room reimplementation of the
  * [[java.io.PipedInputStream]] and [[java.io.PipedOutputStream]] pair of
  * classes which can be used to achieve similar functionality, without the
  * thread bookkeeping which is confusing in a multi threaded environment like
  * the effect systems in which this code runs.
