    * interest, like the size of the file or the last modified time. We then return the entry with

    * return the file that was modified furthest in the past.

    * Our "feature" is the type parameter `A`, which must have an `Order` constraint so that we can
    * compare entries. For the implementation, we simply compute the attributes for each path and
    * then compile the resulting stream using a semigroup which selects the path with the lower
    * extracted feature.
