### Related Scala Libraries

* FS2 was originally called [Scalaz-Stream](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-stream).
* [Monix](https://monix.io/) defines a special type for lazy, pull-based streaming, called `monix.tail.Iterant`.
* [The FP in Scala stream processing library](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala/blob/master/answers/src/main/scala/fpinscala/streamingio/StreamingIO.scala) developed for the book [FP in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)
* There are various other iteratee-style libraries for doing compositional, streaming I/O in Scala, notably the [`scalaz/iteratee`](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/tree/scalaz-seven/iteratee) package and [iteratees in Play](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/Iteratees).
* [Akka-Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/stream/index.html)

### Related Haskell Libraries

Since Haskell is the purely functional lazily-evaluated programming language _par excellance_, it is no wonder that many of the ideas in FS2 were first tried and developed in there.

* [Streaming](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming) is a recent addition to Haskell streaming libraries. It represents a Stream using a `FreeT` monad transformer.
