# Example

FS2 is a streaming I/O library. The design goals are compositionality, expressiveness, resource safety, and speed. Here's a simple example of its use:

```scala mdoc
import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp}
import fs2.{Stream, text}
import fs2.io.file.{Files, Path}

object Converter extends IOApp.Simple {

  val converter: Stream[IO, Unit] = {
    def fahrenheitToCelsius(f: Double): Double =
      (f - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)

    Files[IO].readUtf8Lines(Path("testdata/fahrenheit.txt"))
      .filter(s => !s.trim.isEmpty && !s.startsWith("//"))
      .map(line => fahrenheitToCelsius(line.toDouble).toString)
      .intersperse("\n")
      .through(text.utf8.encode)
      .through(Files[IO].writeAll(Path("testdata/celsius.txt")))
  }

  def run: IO[Unit] =
    converter.compile.drain
}
```

This will construct a program that reads lines incrementally from `testdata/fahrenheit.txt`, skipping blank lines and commented lines. It then parses temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, converts these to Celsius, UTF-8 encodes the output, and writes incrementally to `testdata/celsius.txt`, using constant memory. The input and output files will be closed upon normal termination or if exceptions occur.

Note that this example is specialised to `IO` for simplicity, but `Stream` is fully polymorphic in the effect type (the `F[_]` in `Stream[F, A]`), as long as `F[_]` is compatible with the `cats-effect` typeclasses.

The library supports a number of other interesting use cases:

* _Zipping and merging of streams:_ A streaming computation may read from multiple sources in a streaming fashion, zipping or merging their elements using an arbitrary function. In general, clients have a great deal of flexibility in what sort of topologies they can define, due to `Stream` being a first class entity with a very rich algebra of combinators.
* _Dynamic resource allocation:_ A streaming computation may allocate resources dynamically (for instance, reading a list of files to process from a stream built off a network socket), and the library will ensure these resources get released upon normal termination or if exceptions occur.
* _Nondeterministic and concurrent processing:_ A computation may read from multiple input streams simultaneously, using whichever result comes back first, and a pipeline of transformations can allow for nondeterminism and queueing at each stage. Due to several concurrency combinators and data structures, streams can be used as light-weight, declarative threads to build complex concurrent behaviour compositionally.

These features mean that FS2 goes beyond streaming I/O to offer a very general and declarative model for arbitrary control flow.
