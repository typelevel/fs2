### Typelevel Dependencies

As described in the `README` file, FS2 is based mostly on `cats` and `cats-effect`.

* The `cats` library provides definitions for the typeclasses `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, and `MonadError`.
* FS2 also uses the data type [`cats.data.Chain`](https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/chain.html) from the `cats-core` module. This data structure implements an ordered list-like sequence as a catenable list, which allows for efficient insertion at both ends. This data type was originally developed in `fs2`, where it was called `Catenable`.
* The `cats-effect` library extends the typeclasses from `cats` with other more specialised typeclasses, which describe effectful computations. These type-classes cover resource  bracketing, concurrency, asynchronicity, input-output, timing, and interruption.
* FS2 also uses from `cats-effect` several data structures used for communicating  and coordinating concurrent processes, such as [semaphores](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/semaphore.html), [deferred values](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/deferred.html), [atomic references](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/ref.html). Some of these types were first developed as part of the internal implementation of FS2, but then moved to `cats-effect`.
* From [scodec-bits](https://github.com/scodec/scodec-bits), FS2 uses the `ByteVector` data type to implement bytevector chunks. This is relevant for efficiently processing streams of binary data.
